This project features an interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze Adidas sales data. It provides clear insights into sales performance, product trends, and regional distribution, allowing business stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

The dashboard showcases key business metrics such as Total Revenue, Units Sold, Profit, and Average Selling Price. Users can explore sales performance across various product categories and subcategories, track geographical trends by region and state, and monitor time-based sales patterns using dynamic filters for year, product type, and region.

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query and Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy. SQL was used for initial data extraction and filtering. Custom measures were built using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create interactive visuals and performance indicators. The final dashboard includes bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and KPIs within a user-friendly layout.

This project demonstrates practical skills in business intelligence, data preparation, and visualization. It simulates a real-world scenario where decision-makers use the dashboard to identify high-performing regions, best-selling products, and opportunities for strategic improvement.
